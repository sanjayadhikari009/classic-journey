Awe-inspiring and dramatic, the area epitomises the 'chocolate-box' Alps: lush green pastures and lowland slopes carpeted bright with wildflowers against a backdrop of rugged mountains - all topped off with sun-glistening glaciers.\n\nA stay here uncovers the very best of the region: the stunning Oeschinensee mountain lake enclosed by towering cliffs; the hidden Gasterntal Valley with its glacial meltwaters thundering down a narrow gorge, and an Alpine pass that has been used since Celtic times.\n\nDid we mention the spectacular views? One moment you will be spellbound by the glacial legacy, whilst in another it will be the cobalt blue of the Oeschinensee that will take your breath away. Woodlands, pine forest and open meadows are decorated with lady slippers, fire lilies and more than 25 varieties of scented orchid, where you walk to the the tuneful ringing of cowbells. With the company of the occasional swooping eagle, it is easy to feel on top of the world. Amazingly, all this is accessible on well-defined paths directly from the hotel or after a short bus or cable car ride.\n\nOn arrival at the 3 star Seiler's Vintage Hotel (formerly known as the Hotel Alfa Soleil), your hosts, the charming Seiler family, will provide you with the Kandersteg Regional Travel Pass giving you unlimited use of cable cars and the local bus service. They'll also ensure you receive a full introduction to the area, including insider tips on where to spot the best alpine flowers!\n\nWhen you feel like a rest from walking, there's an elegant lounge, swimming pool, sauna, solarium and gym to keep you entertained. In the evening you can relax and enjoy regional dishes and fine wines in Nico's restaurant.\n\nNB: Some gondolas/cable cars do not operate in early/late season when alternative walks will be proposed.Breathtaking natural beauty: snow-capped peaks, emerald-green slopes, amazing turquoise lakes, meadows thick with flowers\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Classic Swiss Alps Walk","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

Ever since the 9th century, the French Way has led thousands of pilgrims on an 800km journey across northern Spain, winding from the Pyrenees across the wheat fields of old Castile to pass through Leon, the seat of Spanish Kings, full of soaring cathedrals and hushed convents, before entering Galicia. The route then builds to a spectacular finale at Santiago de Compostela's majestic Baroque cathedral, the last resting place of St James the apostle.\n\nYour walk begins in Leon and, in keeping with the pilgrimage route, you walk daily along farm tracks, paths and country lanes, enjoying sociable lunches in restaurants en route. You'll stay in an astonishingly diverse range of properties including restored parish houses, converted water mills and stylish farmhouses, all packed with period features. We've included transfers after breakfast on the first three walking days, after which you'll walk all the way to Santiago. The sense of achievement on arrival is immense, and sharing in this tradition with your fellow pilgrims en route is incredibly rewarding.\n\nEveryone on the Camino has a Pilgrim Passport that can be stamped in bars, hotels and churches along the way to qualify for a certificate from the official Pilgrim Office in Santiago. You'll notice a profound and heart-warming camaraderie with other walkers, as day by day you fall in and out of step with people from all over the world, some of whom have been walking for months, covering hundreds of miles! You'll also find complete strangers cheering you on and wishing you 'Buen Camino!' ('Enjoy your walk!').The Camino de Santiago de Compostela is one of the world's oldest pilgrimage routes, and in 1987 was declared the first European Culture Route.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Walking the Camino de Santiago","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

Vineyards and olive groves dot your route as you head towards Les Imberts and the charming village of Gordes whose architectural delights and tiny streets full of shops and cafes are just perfect for exploring. With the Luberon hills providing an enviable backdrop, you'll make your way to Fontaine-de-Vaucluse, with the option to visit the pretty riverside town of L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, before heading north across the Vaucluse plateau for your final day and stunning views of Mont Ventoux and the Dentelles de Montmirail.Wander through vineyards and olive groves to perched medieval villages and stay in delightful hotels, full of character along the way.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Landscapes of the Luberon Walk","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

This easy paced, gentle walking holiday balances peaceful, off-the-beaten-track discoveries, with the splendour and opulence of some of the finest Renaissance chateaux in France. There's no tough climbing but you're still rewarded with beautifully unspoilt landscapes and enchanting views at every turn.\n\nYou follow a linear route from Blois, passing quiet hamlets and wine villages, before continuing alongside the River Cher through Montrichard, Chenonceaux and Montlouis. Then, you'll enjoy wonderful walks through open fields and sprawling vineyards - with opportunities for wine-tasting - and on to Leonardo da Vinci's bustling town of Amboise. Along the way you'll take in some of France's most impressive chateaux: Chenonceau mesmerises with its iconic arches over the River Cher (be sure to taste the chateau's wine and enjoy a scenic riverside walk); the majestic Chateau d'Amboise is a former royal residence and also houses the tomb of Leonardo da Vinci; while Chateau de Chambord is set in a majestic nature reserve.\n\nThe places you'll stay in have been hand-picked for their superb locations, atmospheric charm, excellent cuisine and warm, friendly owners. As well as chateaux, the Loire prides itself on its delicious local cuisine and wine and we've included 2 evening meals - given the fantastic variety of restaurants on your doorstep, we thought you'd appreciate us leaving the choice to you.This easy paced walking holiday combines pleasant walking along the peaceful Cher and Loire rivers while taking in some of France's most impressive chateaux.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Chateaux of the Loire Walk","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

The awe inspiring architecture is clearly evident, especially in the UNESCO world heritage site of Valletta, Malta's capital city. With so many rich and colourful traditions and excellent gastronomy, there is plenty to tantalise your tastebuds.\n\nBased just outside Valletta in St Julian's, this holiday is perfectly flexible, use your 7 day bus pass to reach the start of the walks and take the bus back at the end and you can explore the best that Malta has to offer. We have suggested a 7 day itinerary for you, however you can take it at your own pace and walk where and when you want each day. Walk around Malta's 'fish tail' where the watch towers along the coast are evident of its history and where there are stunning views across to Gozo and Comino. Take time to enjoy nature at the Majjistral Nature Park and vist ancient tombs and relics along the way.\n\nBeing only 27km long and 14.5km wide you'll see plenty of breathtaking sea views in Malta, with dramatic sandstone cliffs, time worn salt pans and perfect fishing villages where the traditional and colourful Luzzo boats can be seen bobbing around in the bays. Enjoy the sites of the capital Valletta, the smallest capital in Europe and recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It's full of narrow streets, impressive architecture, fountains and ancient city walls, however if you need a rest, there are plenty of cafes, restaurant and bars in which to stop and watch the world go by.\n\nThis single centre holiday is based in a quiet location, either at the Holm Hotel or the Hotel Verdi and on a B\u0026amp;B basis as there are so many excellent restaurants nearby for you to find the best spot for dinner. Valletta is also just a short taxi ride away should you wish to spend an evening in the capital.The largest of the Maltese islands, there is so much to explore in Malta with its rich and varied history.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Secrets of Malta Walking","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

You'll follow ancient paths and shepherd trails through gorges and along stoney coastal paths that meander above hidden coves, along virgin beaches and across pebbly promontories, often within metres of the appetisingly clear waters of the Mediterranean.\n\nStarting in Chania, the most charming city of Crete we head towards the White Mountains (Lefka Ori) which take their name from the shining bleached limestone in summer. Explore the lush Samaria and Agia Irini gorges blanketed with colourful Cretan rock lettuce and Aubretia. Follow the southern coastline from Sougia to Ancient Lissos, known for its famous Temple of Asklepios (Aesculapium), where people came from all over Crete to be cured by the local waters. The temple was destroyed in a great earthquake, but its mosaic floor depicting animals and geometrical patterns is preserved. Continue along the coast to Loutro, passing the chapel of St Pavlos, said to mark the place where St Paul landed on Crete. There are plenty of swimming opportunities along the way and your final walk takes you to Freshwater Beach before returning to Chania.\n\nYou'll be treated to historical sites, fabulous swimming spots and a spectacular variety of birds. The White Mountains have golden eagles and lammergeyers and at lower altitudes you will find bee-eaters, hoopoes, blue rock thrush and golden oreols.This self-guided walking holiday explores the most remote south-west corner of Crete.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Contrasts of Crete Walking","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

Our twin centre holiday is based in Chamonix, fondly referred to as the adventure capital of the world, and in Courmayeur, a classic Italian resort full of character.\n\nOn your very first walk, you'll experience sweeping 360° views over the French, Swiss and Italian Alps - is there a better way to start your trip! As you traverse the trails of Mont Blanc, you'll come across huge glaciers, snow-capped summits, stunning mirrored lakes, and serene foothills painted with wildflowers.\n\nYour 3* accommodations immerse you in traditional alpine hospitality with superb levels of comfort and service. Both hotels are very close to great transport links for cable cars, cog-trains, and mountain buses.\n\nYou have the option to upgrade to 4* accommodations on this trip, please quote W07MP for prices.Walk the highlights of Mont Blanc\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Walking Tour du Mont Blanc","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

was a wonderful break. You stay at a number of very beautiful places: \nScapello, Marettimo and San Vito La Capo. The walking is enjoyable but not \ntoo challenging. There are many opportunities to enjoy the food and culture \nof this part of Sicily; for example the town of Erice and the ancient site of \nSegasta. We also had a chance to spend an evening in Trapani and i would \nreally recommend this too. I hadnt done self-guided walking before but really \nenjoyed it.\nWe went in April and the weather was super. Not too hot so perfect for \nwalking and little rain.\nThe days on Marettimo were just awesome. Its a tiny place. a few hundred \npeople, one bar and restaurant open (sure more open in the summer). The \nresidence you stay in was lovely and the walks lead to amazing views. We \nparticualr enjoyed walking along the coast to the Norman Castle, but it was \nalso lovely going in the restaurant Il Veliero; the menu consisted of laocal \npasta dishes and the catch of the day: so charming, friendly and delicious.\n\n\nAs it was self-guided we only met him once. He was very friendly and positive \nabout Sicily. They were very helpful when bad weather was forecast for \nMarettimo. Rather than have us stuck on the island (as the boat may not have \nrun) they organised for us to transfer to Trapani early and  spend the \nevening there.\n\n\nWe ended our trip with a few days in palermo. This was fantastic and i really \nrecommend it; a great way to round off the trip.\nAlso try cous cous if its on the menu, eat lots of ice cream, visiting the \ntuna factory at Scapello is worth the walk, the B and B at San Vito La Capo \nis in quite a secluded spot which is lovely (the views from the garden at \nbrekie are wondeful) but you may want to buy some supplies/snacks to take on \nyour walks.","rating":{"valueScore":5,"guideScore":5,"activitiesScore":5,"lodgingScore":5,"transportScore":5,"mealsScore":5,"overallScore":5},"reviewedAt":"2018-10-22T00:00:00-07:00","reviewBadge":"provided_by_supplier","source":"exodus-travels","summary":"secrets of sicily: an amazing experience!","operator":{"name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","logoImage":{"attachmentDerivatives":{"small":{"url":"https://static.travelstride.com/store/8b/8e3f648e9649d6a70d17b35b4a62ef/e70fe04aa6a5f33e3a0066441632a4c0.png"},"medium":{"url":"https://static.travelstride.com/store/dc/7e6d9f97824af68739d0f4ae217a09/e70fe04aa6a5f33e3a0066441632a4c0.png"}},"url":"https://static.travelstride.com/store/logo_image/5440797/attachment/766387ef672bcd8c1388f0f12c6c0824.png","alt":"Exodus Adventure Travels","position":null,"attribution":null,"label":null},"Typename":"Operator"},"trip":{"name":"Secrets of Sicily Walk","slug":"exodus-travels-secrets-of-sicily-walk","Typename":"Trip"},"Typename":"Review"},{"authorName":"Anonymous","content":"Great food, great wine and beautiful rolling Tuscany scenery.

The day 2 guided tour of the Sassi districts was excellent - I \nrecommend the extra visit to the (cave) house which includes furnishings.  We \nliked the day 3 wine tasting (food included) at Paco Wines so much that we \nreturned the following night for a meal and bought another bottle of \nPrimitivo to go that didn’t last nearly long enough.\n\n\nThis was a self-guided walk.  I had the hotel confirm each taxi arrangement \nfor the next day.  I believe that was a worthwhile precaution.  All transport \nwas on-time.  “Voucher” was a word well-understood.\n\n\nI recommend using the different walk for the Park of the Rock Churches in \nMatera as suggested by the local Mandala tour agent, but note that the both \nMandala linear walk start and end locations differ from the circular Exodus \nwalk.\n\n\nThe first two-thirds of the day 4 walk to Locorotondo is pleasant, but the \nlast third is not.  The route notes phrase “(pay attention to cars)” does \nnot do justice to the inherent danger walking unprotected on the blind \ncorners on the busy main road.  Request Exodus rethink the last part of this \nwalk.\n\nThe day 7 trip to Otranto involved a 20 minute walk to the Lecce train \nstation, some hours and train changes, and another 20 minute (somewhat \nunpleasant) walk from the Otranto train station to the historic centre of \nOtranto - from which the real part of the walk starts and returns.  The \nPalazzo in Lecce has small rental cars.  If you are comfortable driving in \nItaly, perhaps Exodus could promote that as an option, or Exodus suggest a \ntransport alternative.","rating":{"valueScore":4,"guideScore":4,"activitiesScore":4,"lodgingScore":4,"transportScore":4,"mealsScore":4,"overallScore":4},"reviewedAt":"2018-10-22T00:00:00-07:00","reviewBadge":"provided_by_supplier","source":"exodus-travels","summary":"Enjoyable tour in Puglia and Matera","operator":{"name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","logoImage":{"attachmentDerivatives":{"small":{"url":"https://static.travelstride.com/store/8b/8e3f648e9649d6a70d17b35b4a62ef/e70fe04aa6a5f33e3a0066441632a4c0.png"},"medium":{"url":"https://static.travelstride.com/store/dc/7e6d9f97824af68739d0f4ae217a09/e70fe04aa6a5f33e3a0066441632a4c0.png"}},"url":"https://static.travelstride.com/store/logo_image/5440797/attachment/766387ef672bcd8c1388f0f12c6c0824.png","alt":"Exodus Adventure Travels","position":null,"attribution":null,"label":null},"Typename":"Operator"},"trip":{"name":"Paths of the Amalfi Coast","slug":"exodus-travels-paths-of-the-amalfi-coast","Typename":"Trip"},"Typename":"Review"},{"authorName":"Anonymous","content":"instructions for self guided walking tour were, on the whole, clear and \ndetailed.

The worst thing about the holiday \nwas having to use local buses, especially the ones from Amalfi, which were \ninfrequent and very overcrowded.

Awe-inspiring and dramatic, the area epitomises the 'chocolate-box' Alps: lush green pastures and lowland slopes carpeted bright with wildflowers against a backdrop of rugged mountains - all topped off with sun-glistening glaciers.\n\nA stay here uncovers the very best of the region: the stunning Oeschinensee mountain lake enclosed by towering cliffs; the hidden Gasterntal Valley with its glacial meltwaters thundering down a narrow gorge, and an Alpine pass that has been used since Celtic times.\n\nDid we mention the spectacular views? One moment you will be spellbound by the glacial legacy, whilst in another it will be the cobalt blue of the Oeschinensee that will take your breath away. Woodlands, pine forest and open meadows are decorated with lady slippers, fire lilies and more than 25 varieties of scented orchid, where you walk to the the tuneful ringing of cowbells. With the company of the occasional swooping eagle, it is easy to feel on top of the world. Amazingly, all this is accessible on well-defined paths directly from the hotel or after a short bus or cable car ride.\n\nOn arrival at the 3 star Seiler's Vintage Hotel (formerly known as the Hotel Alfa Soleil), your hosts, the charming Seiler family, will provide you with the Kandersteg Regional Travel Pass giving you unlimited use of cable cars and the local bus service. They'll also ensure you receive a full introduction to the area, including insider tips on where to spot the best alpine flowers!\n\nWhen you feel like a rest from walking, there's an elegant lounge, swimming pool, sauna, solarium and gym to keep you entertained. In the evening you can relax and enjoy regional dishes and fine wines in Nico's restaurant.\n\nNB: Some gondolas/cable cars do not operate in early/late season when alternative walks will be proposed.Breathtaking natural beauty: snow-capped peaks, emerald-green slopes, amazing turquoise lakes, meadows thick with flowers\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Classic Swiss Alps Walk","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

Ever since the 9th century, the French Way has led thousands of pilgrims on an 800km journey across northern Spain, winding from the Pyrenees across the wheat fields of old Castile to pass through Leon, the seat of Spanish Kings, full of soaring cathedrals and hushed convents, before entering Galicia. The route then builds to a spectacular finale at Santiago de Compostela's majestic Baroque cathedral, the last resting place of St James the apostle.\n\nYour walk begins in Leon and, in keeping with the pilgrimage route, you walk daily along farm tracks, paths and country lanes, enjoying sociable lunches in restaurants en route. You'll stay in an astonishingly diverse range of properties including restored parish houses, converted water mills and stylish farmhouses, all packed with period features. We've included transfers after breakfast on the first three walking days, after which you'll walk all the way to Santiago. The sense of achievement on arrival is immense, and sharing in this tradition with your fellow pilgrims en route is incredibly rewarding.\n\nEveryone on the Camino has a Pilgrim Passport that can be stamped in bars, hotels and churches along the way to qualify for a certificate from the official Pilgrim Office in Santiago. You'll notice a profound and heart-warming camaraderie with other walkers, as day by day you fall in and out of step with people from all over the world, some of whom have been walking for months, covering hundreds of miles! You'll also find complete strangers cheering you on and wishing you 'Buen Camino!' ('Enjoy your walk!').The Camino de Santiago de Compostela is one of the world's oldest pilgrimage routes, and in 1987 was declared the first European Culture Route.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Walking the Camino de Santiago","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

Vineyards and olive groves dot your route as you head towards Les Imberts and the charming village of Gordes whose architectural delights and tiny streets full of shops and cafes are just perfect for exploring. With the Luberon hills providing an enviable backdrop, you'll make your way to Fontaine-de-Vaucluse, with the option to visit the pretty riverside town of L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, before heading north across the Vaucluse plateau for your final day and stunning views of Mont Ventoux and the Dentelles de Montmirail.Wander through vineyards and olive groves to perched medieval villages and stay in delightful hotels, full of character along the way.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Landscapes of the Luberon Walk","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

This easy paced, gentle walking holiday balances peaceful, off-the-beaten-track discoveries, with the splendour and opulence of some of the finest Renaissance chateaux in France. There's no tough climbing but you're still rewarded with beautifully unspoilt landscapes and enchanting views at every turn.\n\nYou follow a linear route from Blois, passing quiet hamlets and wine villages, before continuing alongside the River Cher through Montrichard, Chenonceaux and Montlouis. Then, you'll enjoy wonderful walks through open fields and sprawling vineyards - with opportunities for wine-tasting - and on to Leonardo da Vinci's bustling town of Amboise. Along the way you'll take in some of France's most impressive chateaux: Chenonceau mesmerises with its iconic arches over the River Cher (be sure to taste the chateau's wine and enjoy a scenic riverside walk); the majestic Chateau d'Amboise is a former royal residence and also houses the tomb of Leonardo da Vinci; while Chateau de Chambord is set in a majestic nature reserve.\n\nThe places you'll stay in have been hand-picked for their superb locations, atmospheric charm, excellent cuisine and warm, friendly owners. As well as chateaux, the Loire prides itself on its delicious local cuisine and wine and we've included 2 evening meals - given the fantastic variety of restaurants on your doorstep, we thought you'd appreciate us leaving the choice to you.This easy paced walking holiday combines pleasant walking along the peaceful Cher and Loire rivers while taking in some of France's most impressive chateaux.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Chateaux of the Loire Walk","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

The awe inspiring architecture is clearly evident, especially in the UNESCO world heritage site of Valletta, Malta's capital city. With so many rich and colourful traditions and excellent gastronomy, there is plenty to tantalise your tastebuds.\n\nBased just outside Valletta in St Julian's, this holiday is perfectly flexible, use your 7 day bus pass to reach the start of the walks and take the bus back at the end and you can explore the best that Malta has to offer. We have suggested a 7 day itinerary for you, however you can take it at your own pace and walk where and when you want each day. Walk around Malta's 'fish tail' where the watch towers along the coast are evident of its history and where there are stunning views across to Gozo and Comino. Take time to enjoy nature at the Majjistral Nature Park and vist ancient tombs and relics along the way.\n\nBeing only 27km long and 14.5km wide you'll see plenty of breathtaking sea views in Malta, with dramatic sandstone cliffs, time worn salt pans and perfect fishing villages where the traditional and colourful Luzzo boats can be seen bobbing around in the bays. Enjoy the sites of the capital Valletta, the smallest capital in Europe and recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It's full of narrow streets, impressive architecture, fountains and ancient city walls, however if you need a rest, there are plenty of cafes, restaurant and bars in which to stop and watch the world go by.\n\nThis single centre holiday is based in a quiet location, either at the Holm Hotel or the Hotel Verdi and on a B\u0026amp;B basis as there are so many excellent restaurants nearby for you to find the best spot for dinner. Valletta is also just a short taxi ride away should you wish to spend an evening in the capital.The largest of the Maltese islands, there is so much to explore in Malta with its rich and varied history.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Secrets of Malta Walking","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

You'll follow ancient paths and shepherd trails through gorges and along stoney coastal paths that meander above hidden coves, along virgin beaches and across pebbly promontories, often within metres of the appetisingly clear waters of the Mediterranean.\n\nStarting in Chania, the most charming city of Crete we head towards the White Mountains (Lefka Ori) which take their name from the shining bleached limestone in summer. Explore the lush Samaria and Agia Irini gorges blanketed with colourful Cretan rock lettuce and Aubretia. Follow the southern coastline from Sougia to Ancient Lissos, known for its famous Temple of Asklepios (Aesculapium), where people came from all over Crete to be cured by the local waters. The temple was destroyed in a great earthquake, but its mosaic floor depicting animals and geometrical patterns is preserved. Continue along the coast to Loutro, passing the chapel of St Pavlos, said to mark the place where St Paul landed on Crete. There are plenty of swimming opportunities along the way and your final walk takes you to Freshwater Beach before returning to Chania.\n\nYou'll be treated to historical sites, fabulous swimming spots and a spectacular variety of birds. The White Mountains have golden eagles and lammergeyers and at lower altitudes you will find bee-eaters, hoopoes, blue rock thrush and golden oreols.This self-guided walking holiday explores the most remote south-west corner of Crete.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Contrasts of Crete Walking","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.

Our twin centre holiday is based in Chamonix, fondly referred to as the adventure capital of the world, and in Courmayeur, a classic Italian resort full of character.\n\nOn your very first walk, you'll experience sweeping 360° views over the French, Swiss and Italian Alps - is there a better way to start your trip! As you traverse the trails of Mont Blanc, you'll come across huge glaciers, snow-capped summits, stunning mirrored lakes, and serene foothills painted with wildflowers.\n\nYour 3* accommodations immerse you in traditional alpine hospitality with superb levels of comfort and service. Both hotels are very close to great transport links for cable cars, cog-trains, and mountain buses.\n\nYou have the option to upgrade to 4* accommodations on this trip, please quote W07MP for prices.Walk the highlights of Mont Blanc\n\u003c/div\u003e\n","name":"Walking Tour du Mont Blanc","operator":{"featuredStatus":"premier","name":"Exodus Adventure Travels","slug":"exodus-travels","reviewsCount":19463,"Typename":"Operator","id":181,"cancellationPolicy":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe cancellation policies of this trip when booked through Travelstride are determined by the stated policies of the tour operator - Exodus Adventure Travels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you or any other member of your party decides to cancel a confirmed booking you must notify Travelstride in writing.
